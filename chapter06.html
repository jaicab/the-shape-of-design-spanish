          >We sail within a vast sphere,
          ever drifting in uncertainty,
          driven from end to end.
          When we think to attach ourselves
          to any point and to fasten to it,
          it wavers and leaves us;
          and if we follow it,
          it eludes our grasp,
          slips past us,
          and vanishes for ever.
          Nothing stays for us.</a>”
      </q>
      <cite>Blaise Pascal</cite>

      <p class="first">
        The tightrope walker finds his balance by keeping his momentum.
        If he stands still, he will fall;
        if he locks up his limbs, he will throw his balance off.
        He stays on the wire by moving in response,
        swinging his arms up and down,
        and steadily setting one foot in front of the other.
        Like him,
        there are no fixed points in our design work,
        no opportunities to stop and hold still.
        We must respond and move,
        simply because the work moves
        and the space around design shifts
        as culture changes and the adjacent possible grows.
        Design is always in motion;
        we either sway with it
        or we get thrown off the line.
      </p>

      <p>
        The responsive creativity that design requires
        is similar to what installation artist Robert Irwin
        started to do with his art in the 1970s.
        Irwin would make no formal plans
        before arriving at the gallery
        where his work was to be shown.
        Instead, he’d walk into the room
        and spend a great deal of time
        observing the qualities of the space,
        assessing the shape of the room,
        and judging its light.
        He would then devise a plan
        and conceptualize the art
        based on his observations.
        The art he produced
        was a direct response
        to the context of his work.
        The space became his material;
        each piece was an ad hoc exploration.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes the space would suggest more grandiose pieces,
        like his installation at the San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art,
        where Irwin filled a large wall with fluorescent lights
        organized into interlocking modules
        shaped like Tetris pieces.
        Other rooms called for more minimal tactics,
        like his piece at the Museum of Modern Art in New York,
        where he merely changed the fluorescent lighting
        by alternating cool and warm bulbs,
        stretching a piece of scrim below the lights like a second ceiling,
        and stringing wire across the length of the room at eye level
        to prevent the viewer’s eyes from focusing.
      </p>

      <p>
        In either case, Irwin’s process is to show up
        and let the context speak what it requires to him.
        The relationship Irwin has with the space
        reminds me of a few conversations I’ve had
        with portrait photographers about their work.
        One of the points that frequently comes up
        is that the majority of their job
        is to wait for the person
        to reveal their true self
        so that they can make
        an accurate portrait of their subject.
        The process is mostly waiting,
        more like listening than speaking,
        and most photographers say that
        the best shots come at the end of the session,
        because earlier exposures always feel rigid and false.
        The subject’s guard is still up,
        but eventually,
        their true face emerges for the camera.
      </p>

      <p>
        The necessities and influence of subject and context,
        whether in portraiture, installation, or design,
        take time to unfold.
        It is the designer’s job to figure out a way
        to have a problem show its actual self
        so that he can respond to the truth that has emerged.
        Getting to know a problem
        is a bit like getting to know a person:
        it’s a gradual process
        that requires patience,
        and there is no state of completion.
        You can never know the full of a problem,
        because there is never comprehensive information available.
        You have to simply draw the line somewhere
        and make up the rest as you go along.
        Irwin describes his process,
        saying, <a id="chapter06-note02" class="endnote-anchor"
          href="endnotes.html#chapter06-note02"
          >“I took to waiting
          for the world to tell me
          so that I could respond.…
          Intuition replaced logic.
          I just attended to the circumstances,
          and after weeks and weeks of observation,
          of hairline readjustments,
          the right solution would presently
          announce itself.”</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        In other words, Irwin’s process begins by listening:
        to the room, his intuition, and the work as he is making it.
        He then enters a dialogue with the space,
        going near and far just like the painter in the studio.
        Irwin’s gaze, however,
        also contains the space around his work
        and how his piece relates to its context.
        His process favors field-testing on-site
        by improvising in response to the context.
        He summons a more human metric to forecast decisions
        by using instinct instead of logic.
        Logical thinking has a tendency to break
        when all the parts are moving,
        so Irwin speculates with his gut,
        makes a modification,
        then tests it with his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        The physical forms of Irwin’s work
        are not the emphasis of his practice.
        They are only meant to collaborate with the space
        and not intended to have any sort of significance themselves.
        I think this pattern also fits
        with the way that design operates:
        the products of design
        are just the means to an end.
        They are objects whose existence
        is rooted in the need that they serve.
        The primary purpose of the design
        is to have it do something particular,
        not be any particular thing.
        All of this implies that design
        is a field of outcomes and consequences
        more than one of artifacts.
        The forms that designers produce are flexible,
        so long as the results serve the need.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let me give an example.
        Suppose I sent a design brief
        to a few designers
        asking them to design a chair.
        What might I get back?
      </p>

        />
      </div>

      <ul class="img-caption">

          <span class="label osf">Left:</span>
          Traditional Shaker Chair,

          Frank Gehry,
          <span class="osf">1972</span>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We have a multiplicity of chairs
        from three different designers:
        a tall rocking chair from the Shakers,
        a bent plywood seat from the Eames Office,
        and a curved chair made of cardboard by Frank Gehry.
        There are certain similarities and patterns in the chairs,
        because the objectives of the work
        act as a constraint on the process.
        They guide the designer
        to certain inevitable conclusions
        which are necessary to have the design
        fill the need it seeks to serve.
        Each chair has a seat,
        all form a cradle for the sitter,
        and all the chairs are of similar size
        that is based on the proportions of the human body.
        The constants of the designs
        are determined by the unavoidable logistical issues
        that must be addressed
        to make the design useful.
        A chair, for instance,
        must follow certain proportions
        to comfortably hold a human body.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the three chairs clearly have differences
        in structure and style.
        Multiplicity will always crop up with design,
        even in spite of constraints,
        because the work is subjective
        and without fixed solutions.
        The products of design
        are more negotiations of issues
        and responses to problems
        than absolute, fixed solutions,
        and this provides plenty of space
        for different takes and perspectives.
        Grouping the chairs together
        makes it evident that each design
        is an attempt to fill the need of sitting
        seen through the lens of each designer’s disposition.
        Their responses are a negotiation
        of the problem with its context,
        and the designers
        are a part of that context.
      </p>

      <p>
        The success of one design, however,
        does not suggest that the others
        are less useful or not as good.
        Design can have diversity in its solutions to problems
        without compromising the success of any of them.
        One approach does not negate the quality of another,
        so the comfort of a Shaker chair
        does not imply that the other two are uncomfortable
        simply because they are different.
        Gehry’s cardboard chair, for instance,
        has no legs,
        but legs are only necessary
        to support the seat at a proper height.
        Gehry was able to scrap them
        because he found
        a different way to lift the seat.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our chairs differ
        because of the dispositions of their makers,
        but also because they were made
        at various times in different cultures.
        Time and place have a large impact
        on the products of design,
        because they dictate what is possible.
        A Shaker, for instance,
        could not have created the Eames’ chair,
        because plywood did not exist,
        never mind the technology to bend the wood.
        The adjacent possible had expanded in the one hundred years
        between the first Shaker chair and the Eames’ chair,
        which opened up new opportunities
        to rethink how chairs were made.
      </p>

      <p>
        Culture also has an effect
        on the products of design.
        There is no guarantee
        that the Shakers would have found the Eames’ chair desirable to make,
        even if they had the technology needed to produce it.
        The relationship of design and culture
        presents another two-way bridge
        where influence goes both ways:
        culture creates design’s target
        by defining what is desirable.
        Simultaneously,
        the best design recalibrates
        what we think
        and how we feel
        about what surrounds us.
        The two shine on one another:
        culture changes
        what it expects from design
        after design changes culture,
        meaning that when our work hits the target,
        that target moves out from underneath it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The shifting bullseye
        suggests that we should reconsider
        our conception of design
        as a problem-solving endeavor.
        Hitting the bullseye
        is only ever a temporary state,
        and rather than seeing that as a problem,
        we should pull another arrow from our quiver
        and celebrate the moving target
        as the way we inch toward better circumstances.
        We should embrace the subjective nature of what we do
        and allow for the multiplicity of responses to thrive,
        because the mixed pool
        represents the diversity of human perspective.
        That diversity fortifies us,
        makes us strong.
        Most of all,
        we should build movement
        into our definition of the craft
        and its successful outcomes.
        The best design acts as a form
        of loosely composed, responsive movement,
        and seeks to have
        all the adjacent elements
        sway together.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a generous definition,
        much greater than just problem solving,
        because the best design
        has to offer much more
        than making problems go away.
        Design can also build up good, desirable artifacts, experiences,
        and situations that are additive forces in this world.
        It helps us live well
        by producing and elevating new kinds of value,
        such as engagement, participation, and happiness.
        These are design’s true outcomes,
        because the practice, at its root,
        is simply people
        making useful things for other people.
        It’s life-enhancement,
        and we can make it for one another,
        so long as we act responsively
        and keep our momentum moving forward,
        just like the man on the tightrope.
