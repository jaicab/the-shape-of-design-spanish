      <p class="first">
        There are two successful outcomes
        when a design focuses on its audience:
        resonance and engagement.
        Stories speak to the first
        and frameworks to the latter.
        Frameworks are the structures
        that allow for contributions
        to be made to the products of design,
        and increasingly,
        it has become the work of the designer
        to create these frameworks.
        One of the more central questions
        that design must now address is
        how one produces an enticing environment
        for conversation, community, and creativity.
      </p>

      <p>
        A framework is the bridge
        that connects the designer to the audience
        and goes both ways.
        It also nicely resolves a thought
        that crosses my mind frequently while working:
        “What if the audience is smarter than I am?”
        If the audience knows more about what they need
        than the designer does,
        it seems silly to not have a way
        to gather their thoughts, opinions, and proposed solutions.
        Frameworks open up a valve of communication and contribution;
        if effective,
        they reap the rewards of an intelligent and experienced audience.
        A good framework is an enticing means
        of contribution and an invaluable feedback mechanism.
        It gives designer and audience
        shared ownership of the products of design,
        a true synthesis of requirements.
      </p>

      <p>
        Largely, the practices
        that make for good improvisation
        produce good frameworks,
        because both are created to help
        initiate creative work
        and encourage contributions from others.
        I’m reminded of the Japanese <em>renga</em> mentioned earlier,
        where the poets would contribute lines
        and daisy-chain them together
        to create a whole greater than the sum of its parts.
        The framework wasn’t the poem,
        but the structure and methods employed to help produce it.
        There were rules and limitations to the game,
        with social etiquette layered on top,
        and these elements interacted
        to create the materials for the poets’ interaction.
        I think all of these patterns
        apply to contemporary frameworks as well:
        there is the action that needs to be done,
        the tension of creating a worthwhile larger work,
        and the social etiquette necessary to pull it all off.
        The goal is the same now
        as it was in the time of the <em>renga</em>
        &ndash; to build something of quality,
        to have others contribute something of themselves in the process,
        to have those individuals interact with one another
        as a community of contributors.
        All frameworks are implicitly social
        in that they are an environment
        where conversation, sharing, and building occur.
        They’re collaborative.
      </p>

      <p>
        Earlier I discussed improvisation
        as it applies to a personal creative process,
        but more frequently, improv is a social act.
        The results of the improvisation
        are built up through dialogue between many individuals,
        whether it is a group of jazz musicians
        sharing a stage and trading fours,
        or a troupe of improv comedians
        feeding one another material to get laughs.
        And so all of the tenets
        that influence improvisation on an individual level
        also need to be applied collectively for frameworks.
        Contributions must be accepted,
        and then appended by someone else,
        which brings us back to “Yes, and….”
        Momentum also matters here,
        so the materials need to trade hands frequently,
        with tight feedback loops
        to quickly incorporate each contribution to the whole.
        There’s a special satisfaction
        in contributing to something,
        and it becomes even more rewarding
        when everyone can see
        how their part has influenced
        other aspects of the creation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Liz Danzico likes to frame up
        her experiences of contribution
        by telling a story about a saltbox
        that hung beside her mother’s stove
        while she was growing up.
        Occasionally, her mother would ask her
        to add a bit of salt to the pot
        while the meal was on the stove simmering.
        Salting was a way for her to participate in making dinner;
        the salt was an agent of change
        that she could use to contribute to the meal,
        and the saltbox was the structure
        that allowed her to contribute.
        The saltbox, if you will, was the framework.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think the process of salting
        is an apt analogy for a creative offering,
        because the soup in the pot isn’t Liz’s creation,
        but she’s the one who imbues it with flavor by adding salt.
        Salting happens one pinch at a time
        &ndash; it is a gradual process &ndash;
        with success determined by tasting afterwards.
        We judge what we’ve done
        by testing the change we’ve created,
        and that’s how a good framework should feel
        for the audience when they contribute.
        The path is self-correcting,
        because they can observe
        the influence of their actions
        and make changes if needed.
        Maybe the soup needs more salt.
        The feedback loop is purposefully tight.
        That’s why you can trust a child
        to help with dinner without ruining the meal:
        it’s a small effort
        with low risk, but big rewards.
      </p>

      <p>
        Salt releases the food’s natural flavors
        when applied judiciously,
        and this speaks to the benefits of a successful framework:
        it’s not the main dish,
        but a meaningful addition
        to what the audience already wants to achieve.
        It enhances what they already intend to do
        and increases the quality
        of what they would have been able to achieve on their own.
        But frameworks have a tendency to disappear
        when they are intuitive and carefully planned,
        because our attention is on the wonderful fruits of the process.
        We typically only notice frameworks, like salt,
        when something is out of balance.
        Consider salt in a cookie:
        we only taste it when there’s too much or not enough,
        because when the balance is just right,
        we hardly realize it’s there.
      </p>

      <p>
        Frameworks have always existed,
        from game design to the office suggestion box,
        but their importance has been amplified
        by the presence of the internet
        and the opportunities that the web affords.
        Designers must manage
        a new kind of conversation around their work,
        because connectivity has created new opportunities
        for audiences to contribute.
        We are no longer
        only designing logos, brochures, and posters,
        but now also experiences and interactions
        that provide the path for audience engagement.
        If resonance and engagement are our goals,
        then improvisation is the blueprint
        for creating these interactions.
        Improvisation’s ability to manage
        the contributions of others
        and lead them to a desirable outcome
        makes it a prime lens
        to view and understand these new requirements.
      </p>

      <p>
        The proximity of the audience to the work
        should be considered an overlap of interest.
        The designer and audience are now wed in co-authorship,
        with each of their contributions part of the dialogue
        that establishes the characteristics of the project
        and the direction it will take.
        <em>Kind of Blue</em>, for example,
        is credited as an album by Miles Davis,
        but, in truth,
        it is an album made collaboratively
        with all the other musicians in the studio.
        The music did indeed spring
        from the limitations Davis wrote on those slips of paper,
        but once providing the framework,
        he wisely stepped back
        and relinquished complete control and authorship.
      </p>

      <p>
        Designers should do the same
        with the frameworks they produce.
        They should begin
        by setting good restrictions
        that act as suggestions,
        but then step out of the way
        to see where the audience
        takes those purposeful limitations.
        Stepping out of the way
        requires a new way of thinking,
        because the designer can no longer command
        the whole ecosystem of the work
        if others are contributing.
        The control that designers so often desire
        is undermined
        through an unpredictable collaboration with the audience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Again,
        the solution is for the designer
        to sway responsively
        to the shifting context of the work
        with the contributions of the audience.
        The key is to understand
        when to surrender control and let the audience drive,
        and when to exert authority
        to focus everyone’s effort
        to ensure a more meaningful outcome.
        A gentle touch, more often than not,
        is all that’s needed
        to guide things in the right direction.
        One could say that Davis’ genius with <em>Kind of Blue</em>
        was introducing that gentle touch to jazz,
        favoring a few simple scales
        over the elaborate scaffolding of Bebop.
      </p>

      <p>
        A good set of well-chosen rules
        makes the contributor feel like they are already halfway done:
        all that is left to do
        is to sort out the details and execute their idea.
        A good example would be the easy hand-holding of a MadLib 
        &ndash; name a few words, drop them in,
        and then read what funny nonsense results.
        The framework limits what words go where;
        place an adjective here, a verb there,
        then a name, and presto:
        you get a funny story.
        Bad choices in frameworks, however,
        have a tendency to feel too limiting;
        they are frustrating and unclear to the audience
        and squelch any inkling of interest in participating.
        Imagine if the MadLib asked for a present participle
        that modifies a noun as an adjective.
        The value proposition for contributing
        becomes an unappealing one.
      </p>

      <p>
        The contributions of the audience
        fortify the work,
        create identification and ownership in them,
        and solidify the community around the design.
        Frameworks are collaborative and social in nature,
        so etiquette also becomes a concern for the designer.
        I have a friend who collects etiquette books,
        and it’s only recently that I think
        I’ve come to understand why she does this.
        The books highlight the important points
        of our engagements with one another.
        Manners underscore what we feel is proper.
        Etiquette is composed of the rules of engagement,
        and how we interact when we’re together.
        Designers need to think about setting these rules,
        because they exist to grease and ease social interactions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The start of the internet
        produced a lot of discussion about “netiquette”
        to establish the social norms
        that would dictate our interactions
        in this new and unfamiliar digital space.
        Those conversations
        have largely vanished in the past two decades,
        which is a shame,
        because while the web has become increasingly social,
        we haven’t developed many new social protocols
        to handle the glut of demands
        created by socializing online.
        Our initial attempts at netiquette
        translated our existing manners into the digital space.
        We were correct, to a large extent,
        to bring along the behaviors
        that come from kindness and politeness,
        but collective socializing online
        is not a mirror image of doing so in physical space.
        Most relationships are asynchronous and anonymous.
        Believing that a simple one-to-one translation
        of the norms we have in physical space
        should work in digital space
        underestimates the influence
        that our new connectivity
        has over the way we socialize.
        The tools we have
        shape how we use them,
        and the social web, frameworks,
        and their design decisions
        establish how the audience contributes
        and how they relate to one another as individuals.
      </p>

      <p>
        The story about Ogilvy and the blind beggar
        speaks to the consequences
        of when the personhood of an individual
        is amplified or minimized.
        The human presence changes behavior.
        Ogilvy created a space for empathy by telling a story,
        and I think that the decisions of a designer
        can influence whether or not
        users empathize with one another
        when huddled around a framework.
        Empathy is crucial in these cases,
        because frameworks are the means
        to build up things collaboratively.
        Let me give an example.
        A few weeks ago,
        I was using an application on my phone
        that is essentially a framework for sharing photos with friends.
        These friends can comment on the photos and favorite them.
        There is a screen in the application
        that lets you look at the updates
        describing who has liked a photo that you have taken,
        or if new people have shown up
        and subscribed to your stream of photos.
        The interface looks, roughly, something like this:
      </p>

      <div class="img-block">
        <img alt="Interface #1" class="inblockpic"
          src="Images/interface1.gif"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        It’s a nice design,
        and it provides a concise digest
        of activity around the photos that I’ve taken,
        but I think it’s a complete failure
        in reinforcing the emotions
        that make the behaviors it presents meaningful.
        I look at this screen often,
        but the one thing I should feel
        &ndash; thankfulness
        for the kindness and recognition of others &ndash;
        never materializes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Except for the one time it did:
        I opened the application one day
        to discover a rendering bug
        had enlarged the avatars on this screen.
        That one simple change
        made me feel a part
        of this photography framework
        and the community it sustains.
        Seeing the faces of the ones
        who liked my photos
        made me part of a web of mutual appreciation.
        The people snapped back into focus as individuals.
      </p>

      <div class="img-block">
        <img alt="Interface #2" class="inblockpic"
          src="Images/interface2.gif"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        I began to think about the screen’s original design:
        it had information density,
        but it wasn’t a suitable representation of personhood.
        The design was optimized
        for consumption of information
        rather than thankfulness
        for the interactions and relationships it depicts.
        Appreciation is a significant aspect of positive experiences;
        if the design choices
        have been optimized for consumption instead,
        it turns an opportunity
        for nourishing collective resonance
        into a gesture of empty snacking.
        All of which begs the question:
        was the rendering mistake actually a mistake
        if it fixed the most fundamental problem of the original design?
        The bug was eventually fixed
        and the screen returned to the original layout,
        but I want my big faces back.
