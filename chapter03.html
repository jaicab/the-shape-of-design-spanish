      <p class="first">
        When we build,
        we take bits of others’ work
        and fuse them to our own choices
        to see if alchemy occurs.
        Some of those choices
        are informed by best practices and accrued wisdom;
        others are guided
        by the decisions of the work cited as inspiration;
        while a large number are shaped
        by the disposition and instincts of the work’s creator.
        These fresh contributions and transformations are the most crucial,
        because they continue the give-and-take of influence
        by adding new, diverse material
        to the pool to be used by others.
      </p>

      <p>
        Happily,
        these materials do not behave
        like physical materials
        when they are shared,
        because they do not run out.
        Their properties are eloquently explained
        by eighteenth century haiku master Yosa Buson.
        Translated from Japanese, he wrote:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <a id="chapter03-note02" class="endnote-anchor"
          href="endnotes.html#chapter03-note02"
            >Lighting one candle<br/>
             with another candle&mdash;<br/>
             spring evening.</a>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Buson is saying that
        we accept the light contained in the work of others
        without darkening their efforts.
        One candle can light another,
        and the light may spread
        without its source being diminished.
        We must sing in our own way,
        but with the contributions and influence of others,
        we need not sing alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Buson’s haiku is also instructive
        in how to work with the contributions of others.
        Haikus come from an older Japanese poetic tradition
        called <em>renga</em>,
        a form of collaborative, give-and-take poetry.
        One poet would write the first three lines
        of a five-line poem,
        and then pass his work to another poet
        to write the last two.
        From there, the last two lines
        would be used as the basis
        to begin three new lines from a third poet,
        and then another two lines from a fourth.
        The poem went on and on,
        two &ndash; three &ndash; two &ndash; three,
        with each new contribution
        linking into the previous portion
        like a daisy-chain.
        <em>Renga</em> required the acceptance
        of old contributions as the basis for new additions,
        and this arrangement ensured the poem’s strength
        and provided a structure
        that guided the poets during the poem’s creation.
        The poets were able to get to work
        by using what was already there as a material,
        and then building atop previous parts
        with their own contributions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Perhaps Buson’s haiku and the methods of <em>renga</em>
        offer a way to curb the ruthlessness of the blank page.
        They imply that starting from zero
        may be elegantly side-stepped
        through the contributions of others.
        They also show that imposing some sort of structure
        can help us begin and gain momentum.
      </p>

      <div class="img-block">
        <img alt="Three steps in a writing process" class="inblockpic"
          src="Images/writing.gif"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        The first step of any process
        should be to define
        the objectives of the work
        with Why-based questions.
        The second step, however,
        should be to put those objectives
        in a drawer.
        Objectives guide the process
        toward an effective end,
        but they don’t do much
        to help one get going.
        In fact,
        the weight of the objectives can crush
        the seeds of thought necessary
        to begin down an adventurous path.
      </p>

      <p>
        The creative process,
        like a good story,
        needs to start with a great leap of lightness,
        and that is only attainable
        through a suspension of disbelief.
        The objectives shouldn’t be ignored forever,
        but they should be defined ahead of time,
        set aside,
        and then deployed at the appropriate moment
        so that we may be audacious with our ideas.
      </p>

      <p>
        To begin,
        we must build momentum
        and then reintroduce the objectives
        to steer the motion.
        I find the best way
        to gain momentum
        is to think of
        the worst possible way
        to tackle the project.
        Quality may be elusive,
        but stupidity is always easily accessible;
        absurdity is fine,
        maybe even desired.
        If the project is
        a business card for an optician,
        perhaps you imagine it is illegible.
        (This is in the spirit,
        but you can do better.)
        If it is a brochure for an insurance agency,
        imagine otters on the cover
        and deranged handwriting
        on the inside for the copy.
        (Further!)
        If it is design for an exhibition of Ming Dynasty vases,
        brand it as an interactive show for kids,
        and put the vases on precariously balanced pedestals
        made of a shiny metal that asks to be touched.
        (Yes!)
      </p>

      <p>
        The important realization to have
        from this fun &ndash; though fruitless &ndash; exercise
        is that every idea you have after these will be better.
        Your ideas must improve,
        because there is no conceivable way
        that you could come up with anything worse.
        We’ve created the momentum necessary
        to slingshot us toward a desirable outcome
        by stretching our muscles
        and playing in the intellectual mud.
        Now is the time to take the objectives
        out of their drawer
        and use them as the rudder
        to this momentum.
        We must steer our ideas,
        but we can be less discerning
        than if we were starting from scratch,
        because progress at this point
        is going in any direction.
        Any step is guaranteed
        to bring you closer to the border
        that marks the end of bad ideas
        and the start of good ones.
        Even wandering is productive,
        so that is precisely
        what should be done.
      </p>

      <p>
        The way one creatively wanders
        is through improvisation.
        Now that the objectives are in front of us again,
        we can use them as a way
        to guide our ambling
        and riff on ideas.
        It sounds strange,
        but I suspect that while you are riffing,
        you’ll find yourself reusing parts
        of the awful ideas you created earlier.
        The bad ideas have been documented and captured in some way,
        which turns them into a resource
        that can be mined in the process.
        New and better ideas will certainly come as well,
        but mixing the two
        speaks to the cumulative nature of improvising
        and the special sort of presence it requires.
        Ideas build on top of one another,
        and to do so well,
        one must be in the moment,
        actively poking at the current situation
        to use its opportunities
        as material for construction.
        Formalizing the properties of improvising is valuable,
        because it ensures
        that one can respond to the moment
        in artful and fitting ways
        before it fades.
      </p>

      <p>
        We should look to jazz and improvisational theater
        &ndash; the two formalized creative pursuits
        that use improvisation &ndash;
        for guidance.
        Both have developed common rules
        that are meant to ensure a fruitful process.
        The first maxim of improv is “Yes and….”
        This rule is easy to understand,
        but like most cardinal virtues,
        it is much more difficult
        to execute than to grasp.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yes” dictates
        that each contribution is valid and accepted.
        The rules of the game,
        the whims of others,
        and indeed our own,
        preserve momentum
        and keep us from self-editing too early.
        Momentum is the most important aspect of starting,
        and rejecting and editing too soon
        has a tendency to stifle that movement.
        For instance,
        if you and I are improvising a scene on stage,
        and you say something I wasn’t expecting,
        I can’t pull you aside
        and ask you to change your line.
        The continuity would be broken,
        so I must accept what you offer,
        and then build on top of it.
        It’s the same
        whether we are working collaboratively in a group,
        or if I am simply in dialogue with the work
        like the painter at his easel.
      </p>

      <p>
        The “and” part of the “Yes, and…” maxim dictates
        that improvising is an additive process
        that builds itself up with each choice
        like a snowball rolling downhill.
        The back-and-forth dialog
        that happens from these contributions
        in jazz and improvisational theater
        resembles the structure of <em>renga</em>.
        The <em>renga</em> master Basho described
        the spirit of collaborative poetry as transformation:
        the poem achieves a newness when it changes hands,
        has new words added, and cumulatively builds up.
      </p>

      <p>
        That newness only worked,
        in Basho’s words,
        by “refraining from stepping back.”
        To steal from our old analogy
        of stepping back from the easel
        as a way to analyze the work,
        judgment is an important part
        of the creative process,
        but when improvising,
        self-criticism and evaluation from others must be avoided
        in order to let ideas develop from their delicate state.
        Criticism has a crucial role in the creative process,
        but its rigor should match the heartiness of the ideas,
        which become stronger as they develop.
        The more real an idea becomes,
        the less suspension of disbelief is required,
        and the more criticism it should withstand.
        But all ideas,
        both good and bad,
        start young and fragile.
      </p>

      <p>
        This delicacy requires acceptance,
        but rules need to be set before starting
        so the work has a more focused direction to travel.
        Saying no beforehand
        allows yes to be said unequivocally while working.
        These limitations are the fuel for improvisation,
        becoming the barriers
        that hold the sand in the sandbox
        so that we can play.
        The promise of a smaller scope
        makes us forget our fear,
        and the limitations
        become a starting point for ideas.
        An improvisational structure
        allows us to get to work,
        because we no longer need to know precisely
        where we are going
        &ndash; just choose a direction
        and trust the momentum.
        All we need to know
        are the rules of the game.
      </p>

      <p>
        A framework for improvisation
        allows us to get
        into the process of making things
        more easily.
        Perhaps the most famous example
        of an imposed framework
        was created
        by jazz musician Miles Davis
        during the recording of his album,
        <em>Kind of Blue</em>.
        Davis, Bill Evans, Wynton Kelly,
        Jimmy Cobb, Paul Chambers, John Coltrane,
        and Cannonball Adderley
        packed into a <span class="osf">CBS</span> recording studio
        in New York in March of <span class="osf">1959</span>
        without any songs pre-written.
        Jazz musicians routinely tolerated this sort of ambiguity,
        because they made their living by winging it.
        But it’s unlikely that any of them predicted
        that jazz would be reinvented that day.
      </p>

      <p>
        The predominant style of jazz at the time,
        called Bebop,
        was frenetic and lively,
        but had a tendency
        to overstuff songs with notes.
        The abundance sometimes hindered
        the musicians’ melodic expression
        by occupying all the space in the song.
        Bebop has been described as musical gymnastics,
        because the style’s flourishes and showmanship
        forced musicians to negotiate complex structures.
        In spite of the artistry necessary
        to maneuver in the Bebop style,
        it can become too large a load to carry.
        It’s hard to swing
        if there’s no room to move.
        Davis wanted to let the air
        back into the songs,
        to give the musicians
        more space to play.
        They were asked to improvise
        with simple scales and modes
        rather than Bebop’s chord progressions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The recording session began
        with Davis handing each of the seven men
        a small slip of paper
        where he had written down
        a description of their part.
        None of them had seen
        any of the songs
        before coming to the studio,
        but with the guidance
        of the slips of paper,
        they recorded the whole day,
        and booked a second day
        a few weeks later.
        After two sessions,
        the album was finished.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Kind of Blue</em> is unequivocally a masterpiece,
        a cornerstone to jazz music
        created in just a few short hours
        by altering the structure of the performance.
        The musicians accepted the contributions of one another,
        and ventured out into a new frontier,
        using their intuitions as their guides.
        Davis amassed a stellar group of musicians,
        and with a loose framework of limitations to focus them
        but plenty of space for exploration,
        he knew they would wander with skill
        and play beyond themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        Davis’ example is a bit misleading though,
        if only for its efficiency.
        Improvisation is a messy ordeal,
        wasteful in its output,
        and it should be accepted as such.
        The key is to generate many ideas,
        lay them out,
        and try to recognize their potential.
        Don’t be concerned if you improvise
        and don’t use most of the ideas.
        There’s always a significant amount of waste
        when mining for gold.
        (Unless you’re Miles Davis,
        apparently.)

        Limitations and frameworks, however,
        need not be given to us
        only by someone else;
        they can also be
        a self-initiated set of rules
        that open the door to improvisation.
        Many of the greats
        have used limitations
        to encourage their work:
        Vivaldi wrote four violin concertos,
        one for each season.
        Shakespeare’s sonnets follow a specific rhyming scheme
        and are always fourteen lines.
        Picasso, during his Blue Period,
        painted only monochromatically.
        Limitations
        allow us to get to work
        without having to wait
        for a muse to show up.
        Instead,
        the process and the limitations
        suggest the first few steps;
        after that,
        the motion of making
        carries us forward.

        The restrictions of a framework
        take many shapes.
        They may be conceptual
        and based on the content,
        where the limitations
        determine the subject matter
        of the work:
      </p>

      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>
          Write a song
          for each one of the muses.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create an illustration
          for each letter of the alphabet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write a short story
          inspired by each of the astrological signs.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Restrictions can also be structural
        and create compositional limitations:
      </p>

      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>
          Paint on surfaces
          that are three inches wide
          and twenty inches tall.
        </li>

        <li>
          Write a sonnet
          or a haiku.
        </li>

        <li>
          Choreograph a dance
          contained in a six-foot square.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Self-imposed limitations
        might also be related
        to the tone of the work,
        where the inflection of communication
        is deliberately restricted:
      </p>

      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>
          Paint
          monochromatically.
        </li>

        <li>
          Create a song
          using a mistuned guitar.
        </li>

        <li>
          Draw
          with your opposite hand.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Once some restrictions are set,
        it’s helpful to take a step back and assess
        how the qualities of the limitations
        are interrelated,
        because they may offer some suggestions
        about where to begin.
        For instance,
        a restriction in the tone of the work
        can provide guidance for deciding
        what sort of content is best,
        like how only painting in blue
        might suggest sad scenes
        or places bathed in cavernous light.
      </p>

      <p>
        Limitations narrow a big process
        into a smaller, more understandable space to explore.
        It’s the difference between
        swimming in a pool
        and being dropped off
        in the middle of the ocean
        with no land in sight.
        Those limitations also become the basis
        for the crucial first steps in improvisation.
        After those,
        the momentum of making accelerates
        as ideas are quickly generated
        without judgment.
        New ideas interact with the old,
        and spur off into unexpected places.
        Each decision is a response to the last
        and an opportunity to pivot in a new direction,
        so the process imposes a beneficial near-sightedness,
        an inability to see anything clearly
        other than the next step.
        But like driving a car at night,
        a little bit at a time
        is enough to finish the trip.
