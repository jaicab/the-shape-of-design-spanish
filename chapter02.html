          maller than to pay a

          That, as much as anything,

          It’s a small discipline,
          but you can put an awful lot into it.</a>”
      </q>
      <cite>Adam Smith, Knifemaker</cite>

      <p class="first">
        They say all things began as nothing.
        I should believe this,
        but it is difficult to conceive of nothing
        in the middle of a world that is so full.
        I close my eyes and try to picture a darkness,
        but even that is something.
        We are told that there was a big bang
        at the beginning of time
        that created the universe,
        but this turns creation into a spectacle.
        I’m skeptical of showmanship.
        The romantic in me wants to imagine
        there was no flash, no bang.
        Perhaps instead there was a quiet dignity
        to the spurring of matter from nothingness.
        I tell myself a story
        to draw back the darkness and fill the void.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the beginning, a voice slowly approached from afar,
        so unhurried that it was hardly noticeable.
        “Better,” it whispered.
        But no bang, no fireworks.
        No grand gestures or swipes of God.
        The secret closed in and contained the void,
        like how a hushed, familiar voice in the dark
        can create a pocket of warmth around it.
        I picture how the loose gases firmed to make the planets.
        The spheres spun,
        and the atoms collided and combined
        in uncountable ways over billions of years.
        The cocktail thickened and congealed,
        and after an unimaginable number of attempts,
        life showed up, sprawled out, then pushed on.
        We gained hearts and eyes, legs and hands.
        We crawled out of the muck,
        climbed into the trees,
        and eventually came back down.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first boom,
        the recipe that produced the universe and life,
        was born of circumstance.
        The second boom,
        one of the mind and making,
        was by design.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hold a token of the second bang in my hands.
        No bang, no show
        &ndash; most would say what I’m holding is just a rock.
        Walk into any proper house of curiosities
        and ask to see their hand axes.
        They will show you something similar to what I hold:
        a stone resembling an arrowhead
        with a tip that is honed and sharp.
        It will be close to the size of a deck of cards
        and fit comfortably into the hand.
        Hand axes are frequently cited as the first human-made objects;
        the oldest specimens, discovered in Ethiopia,
        are estimated to be about two-and-a-half million years old.
        We have been molding this world for a very long time.
      </p>

      <p>
        The hand axes record the first moment
        that we understood that the world was malleable
        &ndash; that things can change and move,
        and we can initiate those transformations ourselves.
        To be human is to tinker,
        to envision a better condition,
        and decide to work toward it
        by shaping the world around us.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this way, design is a field of transformations
        concerned with the steps we take to mold our situations.
        The maker of this hand axe
        transformed a rock into a tool
        which allowed him to turn a sealed nut into an open platter;
        it allowed him to turn beasts on the plain into dinner.
        The same making instinct was at play
        when the Wrights flew their first airplane
        or when Greek architects sat down to mastermind the Parthenon.
        The products of our endeavors sprawl out behind us
        in a wake of repercussions
        and remain, in some cases,
        for millions of years.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is often a diligence
        in construction to these axes,
        an elegant symmetry to their form.
        These details don’t necessarily
        contribute to the utility of the tool,
        but their presence implies
        that we’ve cared about craft
        ever since our minds
        first opened up to the idea of invention.
        A polished axe does not chop better,
        just as the refined design of a lamp
        does not necessarily light a room more fully.
        Beauty is a special form of craft
        that goes beyond making something work better.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Shakers have a proverb that says,
        “Do not make something unless
        it is both necessary and useful;
        but if it is both,
        do not hesitate to make it beautiful.”
        We all believe that design’s primary job is to be useful.
        Our minds say that so long as the design works well,
        the work’s appearance does not necessarily matter.
        And yet, our hearts say otherwise.
        No matter how rational our thinking,
        we hear a voice whisper
        that beauty has an important role to play.
      </p>

      <p>
        The hand axe is a prime specimen
        to consider beauty’s role
        in this tangle of concerns,
        because the stone’s waned usefulness
        lets us consider its aesthetic appeal on its own.
        Despite the axe’s utilitarian origin,
        the experience of buying my particular hand axe
        was more like purchasing a piece of jewelry
        than something kept in the toolbox.
        The determinate factor was
        how pleasing each hand axe was to my eye.
        The aesthetic details I found desirable
        were the same to the person who made the hand axe.
        This overlap connects me to the past;
        someone long ago had an eye similar to my own,
        and cared enough about the tool’s beauty
        to choose a rock with an even finish,
        then mold it into a pleasing symmetry.
        That care remains intact inside the stone.

      <p>
        Craft links us to a larger tradition of makers
        by folding the long line
        that connects us across the vast expanse of time.
        I am in awe of the brushwork of Van Dyck
        even though the paintings were made four hundred years ago.
        My jaw drops at the attention to detail
        in Gutenberg’s original forty-two line Bible,
        and can’t help but be impressed
        by the ornamental patterns of Arabic mosques
        and their dizzying complexity.
        We all bask in the presence of beauty,
        because there is a magical aura to high craft.
        It says,
        “Here is all we’ve got.
        This is what humankind is capable of doing,
        with every ounce of care and attention
        wrung out into what’s before you.”
        Craft is a love letter from the work’s maker,
        and here in my hands
        is that note enveloped in stone.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m reminded of a piece of advice I received
        during my third year at university.
        I was preparing to go to a design conference
        to show off my portfolio
        in an attempt to land a summer internship.
        The day before I left,
        I stepped into my favorite professor’s office with my portfolio
        to give him a second look at everything.
        I had done most of the projects in his classes,
        but I thought one last bit of feedback might be helpful.
        He was on the phone,
        but he still waved me in,
        and pointed to a empty spot on his desk
        so he could browse my book while on his call.
        He flipped through the pages quickly,
        saying the occasional “Yes” and “Okay.”
        The words were most likely to the woman on the line,
        but I sat on the other side of his desk
        imagining that they were in approval of my work.
        Finally, he got to the last page
        and asked the woman on the line to hold for a moment.
        He held the phone to his chest,
        looked at me,
        and simply said,
        “Needs more love.”
        He pushed the portfolio back across his desk,
        smiled warmly,
        and shooed me out of his office.
      </p>

      <p>
        I still think about this advice,
        and what exactly he might have meant
        when he said my work needed more love.
        At the time, I took it to mean
        that I should improve my craft,
        but I’ve come to realize
        that he was speaking
        of something more fundamental and vital.
        My work was flat,
        because it was missing the spark
        that comes from creating something you believe in
        for someone you care about.
        This is the source of the highest craft,
        because an affection for the audience
        produces the care necessary to make the work well.
      </p>

      <p>
        This kind of affection
        has a way of making itself known
        by enabling those who come in contact with the work.
        In the seventeenth century, for example,
        Antonio Stradivari achieved
        what many consider to be the pinnacle of craft
        in the instruments that he made.
        He produced about five hundred violins in his life,
        and those still remaining
        are coveted by players around the world.
        It’s said that their sound is lush and transcendent,
        and one can imagine Stradivari
        hunched over the body of one of his violins,
        meticulously fine-tuning the details
        to create the most divine sound.
        Stradivari’s secret recipe has long been lost,
        but modern science has given a bit of insight into his methods
        through the analysis of his instruments.
        Some experts believe the secret to his violins
        lies in their filler and varnish,
        which is believed to contain volcanic ash,
        insect wings, shrimp shells, and
        <a id="chapter02-note02" class="endnote-anchor"
          href="endnotes.html#chapter02-note02"
          >“tantalizing traces of organic compounds
          that could be bedroom residues, sweat,
          or pheromones of the master’s own breath.”</a>
        Secret recipe, indeed:
        each instrument was a beautiful union,
        where the maker was himself
        a material used in the construction.
        There is no way to describe Stradivari’s work
        other than as a labor of love.
      </p>

      <p>
        The work has enough love
        when enthusiasm transfers
        from the maker to the audience
        and bonds them.
        Both are enthusiastic about the design.
        I can imagine the excitement in the room
        when Stradivari would hand his newest violin to a skilled musician,
        because the violinist would unlock the instrument’s full potential
        by playing it.
        The products of design,
        like Stradivari’s violins,
        possess an aspect
        that can only be revealed
        through their use.
        It is why I’m always compelled
        to pick up my hand axe
        and roll it around in my hand,
        rather than letting it sit on the mantle.
        The stone is pleasing to the eye,
        but it was made for the hand,
        so it feels more appropriate
        to hold than display.
        And it’s when I hold the hand axe
        that I can hear the voice that whispers “better,”
        sense how the line that connects me to the past folds,
        and feel a love inside that rock.
        In truth, there are two sets of hands on this stone,
        and it’s by holding the hand axe
        that it begins to unfold its true magic.
        The stone, in spite of all these years,
        is still warm
        from the hands of the one who made it.
