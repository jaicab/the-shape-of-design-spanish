      <cite>Issac Asimov</cite>

      <p class="first">
        There’s something about speaking,
        even if only to oneself,
        that makes the mind work.
        Our verbal cowpaths
        are paved through conversation.
        Speaking to ourselves
        is a crude tool
        to hack our way
        toward clearer thinking.
        But in spite of its obvious benefits,
        I become self-conscious
        when I’m caught talking to myself.
        I freeze.
        I try to find a chair to hide behind.
        I cover my eyes,
        pull my cap down,
        and pretend that
        if I can’t see them,
        they won’t see me.
        I’m not here.
        I’ve just disappeared.
        The man you saw talking to himself
        was only a part of your imagination.
      </p>

      <p>
        Perhaps my embarrassment
        comes from a private activity
        made public by its discovery.
        Or it could be that to be caught
        speaking without a listener
        is suspicious and embarrassing.
        Speaking requires an audience;
        the speaker and listener are bonded.
        The Russian polymath Mikhail Bakhtin declared
        that the primary position in conversation
        is the one listening rather than the speaker.
        One must have an audience to begin to speak,
        and perhaps this is a clue
        as to why we talk to ourselves:
        we monologue to listen.
      </p>

      <p>
        The point of speaking,
        and likewise creating,
        is to have someone there to receive.
        The results of our efforts
        must move toward others;
        similarly,
        design must move to be effective,
        whether by filling needs
        or communicating with an audience.
        It should move like a provocative word:
        out, and then around.
        One set of hands makes the work,
        then it passes to another to use.
        The presence of the audience
        is what imbues the designer’s work
        with its worth.
      </p>

      <p>
        As such, it is never
        just the designer’s hands doing the shaping.
        All design
        springs from a complex social ecosystem
        created by multiple parties’ interests
        weaving together to produce the design.
        The players in the arrangement are familiar:
        the client, who commissions the work;
        the audience, who sees or uses it;
        and the designer in the middle,
        who produces the artifact
        that will join the client and audience
        to one another in a relationship.
        The needs and desires of the audience are bonded
        to the capabilities of the client
        under the auspicious hope
        that they complement and enable one another.
        In this guise,
        design not only becomes a way
        to push toward a desirable future,
        but also works to establish
        the vocabulary we use
        to define the terms of our engagements
        with one another.
      </p>

      <p>
        The best way to describe design
        is that it seeks to connect things
        by acting as a bridge between them.
        The design of a book
        connects the author and her ideas to the reader
        by complementing her writing.
        The design of a restaurant
        is meant to fuse with the chef’s culinary approach
        to create a more provocative and full dining experience
        for the eater.
        Web design connects the user to the site’s owner
        and offers a venue for the connection to develop and grow.
      </p>

      <p>
        Design’s ability to connect
        requires it to be in the middle position.
        The work’s qualities are defined
        by the characteristics of what surrounds it,
        like how the negative space
        between two closely placed parallel lines
        creates a third line.
        We’re that third line,
        frequently shifting
        in order to serve and respond
        to the elements around us.
        As the elements connected by design change,
        so, too, does the design.
        The field is in flux,
        always being neither this nor that,
        which makes it frustrating
        to try to pin down.
        It is, like all shape-shifters,
        evasive and slippery.
      </p>

      <p>
        The qualities of design consistently change,
        because there is a wide variety
        of characteristics in what design connects.
        It means that design lives in the borderlands
        &ndash; it connects, but it does not anchor.
        The work must provide a path
        without having a specific way of its own.
        The design is always the middle position,
        but rather than acting as an obstruction,
        it should be the mortar
        that holds the arrangement together.
      </p>

      <p>
        One way that design finds itself in the middle
        is by its ability to establish the tone of the work.
        As described earlier,
        design seeks to negotiate
        the qualities of the content
        with the affordances of the format
        to produce a cohesive whole
        greater than the sum of the parts.
        This situation largely describes
        many of the formal challenges
        faced by designers in their work.
        A wise design choice
        finds the tone
        that can slip
        between the content and format,
        snap into place,
        and bond one to another.
      </p>

      <p>
        Design also finds itself
        in the middle of art and commerce.
        The practice’s hybrid quality
        breeds different opportunities
        than either practice can alone,
        allowing for a special sort
        of influence on culture.
        Design can speak the tongue of art
        with the force of commerce.
        The products of design maneuver
        in the streets of the city
        where people live,
        rather than the halls of a museum
        where they must be visitors.
        There needn’t be the pressure
        of artistic credibility
        or commercial profitability
        always present,
        which means
        that the work of the designer
        can go further
        in shaping culture
        than a traditional piece of art,
        and make money
        in a way
        that has more soul and spill-over benefits
        than straight commerce.
      </p>

      <p>
        Design’s connective role
        is meant to support
        the movement of value
        from one place to another
        for a full exchange.
        It means that the products of design
        are not autonomous objects,
        but are creations
        that bridge in-between spaces
        to provide a way
        toward an intended outcome.
        The design must be transformative
        for it to be successful.
        It must take us somewhere.
        Airports and train stations
        are other examples of non-autonomous creations
        that exist as in-between spaces,
        because they have been built
        out of our desire to go somewhere else.
        Even cathedrals could be considered spaces of transit,
        because they seek to connect the physical world
        with the spiritual realm.
        Design is akin to these places
        in that their usefulness is defined
        by the consequences of the connections they facilitate.
        A train station that doesn’t create a lust for exploration is flawed,
        just as a cathedral that doesn’t inspire awe is a failure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Design’s middle position
        requires it to aid movement
        in both directions.
        The most useful bridges,
        after all,
        allow traffic to go both ways.
        If value is expected
        to be mutually exchanged,
        it means that influence on the design
        will come in both directions
        from the things the design connects.
        The content and the format,
        for instance,
        both mold the appropriate choices for the tone.
        Art and commerce each push and pull on the design,
        because the work must be artful as well as profitable.
        From a social perspective,
        the client and the audience
        both have a say
        in the design decisions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The last is perhaps the most complicated,
        because the designer adds a third influence to the mix.
        She is trying to satiate her own creative needs in the work as well.
        There is no guarantee,
        as many experienced designers can attest,
        that the requirements of each individual
        in this tangle of interest
        will be the same.
        Each comes to the design
        requiring something different.
        Those differences mean
        it is design’s job
        to negotiate the problem space
        &ndash; to create a way
        for the connection to be built.
        The parties’ values don’t have to be in parity,
        their desires simply have to be compatible
        for the work to have a chance at success.
      </p>

      <p>
        One point of complication
        is that these negotiations frequently happen during production,
        so the audience is not yet present.
      </p>

      <p>
        The designer, therefore,
        acts as a proxy for the audience’s needs
        while arguing for her own creative concerns.
        This makes the whole arrangement precarious,
        because it means that the designer
        is being paid by the client,
        but is obligated to the audience,
        for it is the audience’s presence
        that imbues the work with its value.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is a double-allegiance,
        a necessary duplicity.
        Design’s two-faced behavior
        is a product of its middle position
        between the elements it connects.
        Bridging two things
        means a bond with both of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our duplicity is no bad thing;
        in fact, it is necessary,
        simply because things must move two ways at once
        for a full exchange.
        We are molding a complex, multi-faceted setting,
        so our approach
        to improving our conditions and shaping the world
        should be the same way.
        Nothing is ever clear-cut
        when working in a shape-shifting practice
        to negotiate complicated terrain.
        Some trickery is necessary
        to get things moving
        once they are connected.
      </p>

      <p>
        Untruths are what initiate change,
        because they describe an imagined, better world,
        and offer a way to attain it.
        Tantalizing visions of the future
        are the lure that gets us to bite.
        The only question is
        whether the fabrication
        improves our lot
        or buckles under us.
      </p>

      <p>
        The future is pliable, unknown, and weighty.
        On the other side of today
        there is vagueness
        &ndash; a multitude of directions
        the world could sway.
        The areas of uncertainty
        get filled up with speculation.
        We’ve invented a suite of ways
        to grapple with the future
        throughout the course of human history,
        from the perceived ethereal wisdom
        in the entrails of ritual livestock
        in ancient Rome,
        to the calculated metrics
        in the odds of a boxing match
        in Vegas.
        We flirt with the future
        and poke at it
        in order to believe
        we exert some control
        over what’s to come.
        If this means
        divining some imposed meaning from tea leaves,
        so be it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Modern people,
        unlike the ancients,
        have a different relationship with the future,
        because we understand
        that it’s something to be made
        rather than a destiny
        imposed by the gods
        or the whims of fortune.
        Future arrangements
        begin in our mind
        as images of things
        that don’t exist.
        Our interpretations of tomorrow
        are productive fictions
        that we tell one another
        to seduce us
        into believing our ideas are possible.
        We speak beneficial untruths
        that act as hypotheses,
        forcing us to roll up our sleeves
        and work with cleverness and dedication
        to bring them to fruition.
        We work to change fiction into fact
        when we attempt to better our condition.
      </p>

      <p>
        An alluring, productive untruth
        is frequently what’s necessary
        to get things going.
        Consider how we behave
        on New Year’s Eve
        when we make our resolutions.
        We weave an illusion
        and imagine ourselves
        fifteen pounds lighter,
        giving more time to our community,
        or phoning home more often.
        We fabricate ourselves
        into better people
        to inspire the actions necessary
        to become the fitter husband,
        the more loving daughter,
        or the better citizen.
        We use that image of ourselves as motivation
        as we work to close the gap
        between what we’ve imagined and what is true.
        Molding the world works the same way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every untruth forks reality
        and opens up a gap
        between what is imagined to exist
        and what actually does.
        Each fabrication
        creates a second version of the world
        where the untruth is true.
        Consider an entrepreneur
        standing before a few investors
        describing a technology
        she’s developing.
        She is speculating
        about the potential applications
        of her research.
        The work,
        at this point,
        hasn’t been applied in the market,
        and all she has
        are promising lab tests.
        Her proposal forks reality:
        we live in a world
        where the technology
        hasn’t been applied yet,
        but the vision
        that the entrepreneur weaves
        about potential opportunity and profit
        determines whether or not
        the investors choose to risk their money.
        They invest if they perceive
        she can close the gap
        between the world as it is that day,
        and the world she wants it to be.

        In an ideal situation,
        all fiction would improve our collective condition,
        but as we know,
        not everyone is interested in making good on their promises.
        Fiction can also be corrosive
        and deteriorate the foundations of what’s already been built,
        undermining the stability of our arrangements
        rather than helping to build new things
        or strengthen existing structures.
        Lies corrode our understanding of reality
        by misrepresenting it,
        like a snake-oil salesman
        that goes from town to town promising medicine,
        but selling swill.
        Snake-oil salesmen fork reality
        just like the visionary,
        but they have no intention
        of closing the gap
        that opens up with their lie.
      </p>

      <p>
        The salesman doesn’t tell an untruth
        in order to get us to work towards it.
        Instead, he misrepresents what is in front of us
        so that we buy into a mirage.
        It’s a messy distinction,
        and it’s why design, rhetoric, and politics
        are so sticky and often mistrusted:
        the language we use
        to build the world
        is so close to what can be used
        to undermine it.
        Design and persuasion are manipulative,
        and if we have the skills
        to seduce others toward green pastures,
        we can also lead them off a cliff.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the threat of a cliff
        is the cost of the pasture.
        The world swells, pivots, and grows
        when we close the gaps of our untruths.
        A willingness to imagine things differently
        and suspend our disbelief for one another
        are the interfaces we create to shape the world.
        Every time we tell an untruth,
        we confess that the world is not yet done.
        We have a hunger for a better condition,
        and we are, if nothing else, optimistic.
        The only way forward
        is through something we’ve never done,
        so we run full speed
        into the great imagined unknown
        to make this world
        for one another.
